This is an unmodified version of [GradCache](http://github.com/luyug/GradCache) packaged with a slightly modified version of the Supervised Contrastive Loss from [Syn-Rep-Learn](https://github.com/google-research/syn-rep-learn), specifically [StableRep](https://github.com/google-research/syn-rep-learn/tree/main/StableRep). This repo was created for convenience. To use, check out [GradCache](http://github.com/luyug/GradCache), the only difference here is that the labels are passed as a loss_kwargs parameter to the gc step.
